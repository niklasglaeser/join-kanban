            <br>
            <p><span class="hightlight-join">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by
                a group of dedicated students as
                part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
                <br>
                <br>
                Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
                work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span class="hightlight-join">Join</span> leverages
                the principles of kanban to help
                users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.
                <br>
                <br>
                It is important to note that <span class="hightlight-join">Join</span> is designed as an educational
                exercise and is not intended for

                                    Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent

                                    Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it.
                                    Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution
                                    when deleting cards, as this action is irreversible.
